                <p>I includ two interesting applications in my website. You can find it easily. Feel free to try both of them to find out!</p>
                <p>The Meal Finder application enables you to find out recipes of your target ingredient or a specific food name. It can also randomly generate recipes if you don't know what to cook. 
                    The Breakout Game application enables you to play a breakout game. You can read the rules of the game before start playing. Do your best to get high scores!

               <p>Are you like most people who struggle to figure out what's for dinner? It sometimes seems an impossible task for someone who has no idea what to prepare.
                   In Meal Finder, you don't even have to struggle with deciding what to eat! Just click the random button and Meal Finder would randomly generate food recipes for you!

            <p>Breakout Game begins with five rows of bricks. Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to ricochet the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player's paddle misses the ball's rebound, they will lose a turn.</p>
